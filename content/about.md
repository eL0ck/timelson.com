title: About Me
---

I'm a Cloud Applications Architect. Formally educated in Math/Physics I started working in Cryptography and later in technical trading (HFT and Algorithmic trading) before becoming a consultant.

My core interests are in IoT systems and production machine learning.

I currently consult, as a hands-on Architect, to organisations looking to improve their use of publicly available cloud resources.
